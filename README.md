# PokemonEncyclopedia
For the best experience it is preferable to run this app on mobile.

## Running the app on mobile device
Firstly you need to install **Expo Go** from App Store or from Google Play
The next step is to open this project on your IDE and type _npx expo start --tunnel into terminal_.
It will show the QR code that is need to be scanned via your camera app on IOS or QR code scanner on android.
Sometimes project is taking up to ~2 minutes for getting ready, but it should work fine.

## Running the app on Snack 
The app is avaliable here: [https://snack.expo.dev/@wiktoriaczech/github.com-wiktoriaczech-pokemonencyclopedia]
but it's giving me Failed to resolve dependency '@react-navigation/native erros so its strongly recomended to use first option to view the app.
